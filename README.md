# MDA Project
Project Modern Data Analytics 2024 Master of Statistics and Data Science KU Leuven

Running this project requires: Python 3.10.12 and installation of all packages in the requirements.txt.

The aim of this research project is to develop a dashboard application to reduce time to ROSC by guiding the emergency response system with access to this innovative dashboard. The time interval of the arrival of professional medical transport will be compared with the estimated time interval of fetching the nearest AED by a bystander in the Belgian setting. Our hypothesis is that this is a superior or non-inferior first response intervention to achieve return the spontaneous circulation (ROSC) as soon as possible as early defibrillation in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) can ameliorate the outcomes of patients (Nakahara, 2015; Tateishi, 2023).

Not all the Datasets could be uploaded to GitHub because of their size, but all the Datasets that we use are the same ones on Toledo from the course Modern Data Analytics.

The map is intentionally not loaded in the project.ipynb file, hence the error, because including it would make the file size too large to upload to GitHub
